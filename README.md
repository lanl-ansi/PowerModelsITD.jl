`PowerModelsITD.jl` is an extention package of PowerModels.jl and PowerModelsDistribution.jl for Steady-State Integrated Transmission-Distribution (ITD) Power Network Optimization. It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging power network formulations and algorithms in a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications (e.g. Power Flow, Optimal Power Flow, ...) from power network formulations (e.g. AC polar, AC rectangular, linear-approximation, SOC-relaxation, ...) on both transmission and distribution system(s). Thus, enabling the definition of a wide variety of ITD power network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.

## Core Problem Specifications

- Integrated T&D Power Flow (pfitd)
- Integrated T&D Optimal Power Flow (opfitd)
- Integrated T&D Optimal Power Flow with on-load tap-changer (opfitd_oltc)
- Integrated T&D Optimal power flow at transmission and minimum load delta at distribution system (opfitd_dmld)

## Core Network Formulations

**Note**: _left_ is the formulation used to model the transmission system - _right_ is the unbalanced formulation used to model the distribution system(s).

- Nonlinear
  - ACP-ACPU
  - ACR-ACRU
  - IVR-IVRU
- Relaxations
  - SOCBF-SOCUBF (W-space)
- Linear Approximations
  - NFA-NFAU
  - DCP-DCPU
- Hybrid
  - ACR-FOTRU (First-Order Taylor Rectangular)
  - ACP-FOTPU (First-Order Taylor Polar)
  - ACR-FBSU (Forward-Backward Sweep)
  - SOCBF-LinDist3Flow
  - BFA-LinDist3Flow

## Network Data Formats

- **Transmission**: Matpower ".m" and PTI ".raw" files (PSS(R)E v33 specification)
- **Distribution**: OpenDSS ".dss" files
- **Boundary**: JSON ".json" files

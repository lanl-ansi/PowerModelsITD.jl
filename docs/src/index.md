## What is PowerModelsITD.jl?

[PowerModelsITD.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsITD.jl) is a Julia/JuMP-based package for modeling and optimizing integrated transmission-distribution (ITD) power networks.

## Resources for Getting Started

Read the [Installation Guide](@ref Installation-Guide).

Read the [Quickstart Guide](@ref Quick-Start-Guide).

Read the [File Formats Guide](@ref File-Formats-Guide).

Read the introductory tutorial [Introduction to PowerModelsITD.jl](@ref Introduction-to-PowerModelsITD).

## How the documentation is structured

The following is a high-level overview of how our documentation is structured. There are three primary sections:

- The **Manual** contains detailed documentation for certain aspects of PowerModelsITD.jl, such as the [Data Models](@ref DataModelAPI), the [Network Formulations](@ref FormulationAPI), or the [Optimization Problem Specifications](@ref ProblemAPI).

- **Tutorials** contains working examples of how to use PowerModelsITD.jl. Start here if you are new to PowerModelsITD.jl.

- The **API Reference** contains a complete list of the functions you can use in PowerModelsITD.jl. Look here if you want to know how to use a particular function.

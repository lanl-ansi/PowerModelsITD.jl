## How the documentation is structured

The following is a high-level overview of how our documentation is structured. There are three primary sections:

- The **Manual** contains detailed documentation for certain aspects of PowerModelsITD.jl, such as the [Data Models](@ref DataModelAPI), the [Network Formulations](@ref FormulationAPI), or the [Optimization Problem Specifications](@ref ProblemAPI).

- **Tutorials** contains working examples of how to use PowerModelsITD.jl. Start here if you are new to PowerModelsITD.jl.

- The **API Reference** contains a complete list of the functions you can use in PowerModelsITD.jl. Look here if you want to know how to use a particular function.

abstract = "Conventional electric power systems are composed of different unidirectional power flow stages of generation transmission, and distribution, managed independently by transmission system and distribution system operators. However, as distribution systems increase in complexity due to the integration of distributed energy resources, coordination between transmission and distribution networks will be imperative for the optimal operation of the power grid. However, coupling models and formulations between transmission and distribution is non-trivial, in particular due to common practice of modeling transmission systems as single-phase, and distribution systems as multi-conductor phase-unbalanced. To enable the rapid prototyping of power flow formulations, in particular in the modeling of the boundary conditions between these two seemingly incompatible data models, we introduce PowerModelsITD.jl, a free, open-source toolkit written in Julia for integrated transmission-distribution (ITD) optimization that leverages mature optimization libraries from the InfrastructureModels.jl-ecosystem. The primary objective of the proposed framework is to provide baseline implementations of steady-state ITD optimization problems, while providing a common platform for the evaluation of emerging formulations and optimization problems. In this work, we introduce the nonlinear formulations currently supported in PowerModelsITD.jl, which include AC-polar, AC-rectangular, current-voltage, and a linear network transportation model. Results are validated using combinations of IEEE transmission and distribution networks."
